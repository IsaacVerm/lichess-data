https://lichess.org/Kn6AVAn1/white#57,"focus on single variation","Didn't think I still had a flight square for my bishop on f2. Should have checked twice because I was sacking a bishop"
https://lichess.org/1OKd6DC0/black#46,"too complicated position","I should have played Bf4 making sure g5 is no longer possible for him. Defending against his pawn storm is possible but very risky."
https://lichess.org/IgQJOxTk/black#30,"released tension too early", "Rxa4 would have kept the pin alive."
https://lichess.org/DMPnHIN2/black#66,"wrong move order", "Even though taking the rook right away with my knight isn't bad, even better is first exchanging the rook away."
https://lichess.org/CpRc0qRv/black#12,"underdeveloped","I was scared of his e5 pawn push but in itself that's nothing dangerous."
